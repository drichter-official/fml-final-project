## ðŸ“– **Overview**
This repository contains the final project for the **Fundamentals of Machine Learning** course, where we developed **reinforcement learning models** to master the game **Bomberman**. The main objective was to design and implement:
- A **Q-table agent**.
- A **Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN)** agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

The project emphasizes the practical application of reinforcement learning in a **grid-based strategic environment**.

## ðŸ“„ **Project Highlights**
- **Q-Learning Implementation**: Built a Q-table-based agent to navigate the grid and collect coins efficiently.
- **Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN)**: Designed a CNN architecture to handle complex scenarios involving multiple agents, bomb placements, and strategic movements.
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Agent-centered field of view.
  - Temporal fields to predict bomb explosions.
  - Dynamic reward shaping for learning optimization.
- **Challenges Overcome**: Addressed issues like catastrophic forgetting, overfitting, and exploration-exploitation balance.
